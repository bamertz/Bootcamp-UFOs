## Summary

### Drawback
The main drawback to this webpage is that the filters are case sensitive. You must type in the filterable ID exactly as it is written in the table. 

### Recommendations
1. Enhance the filters to avoid case sensitivity. For example, allow "California" to be typed instead of just "ca".
2. Build a drop down list instead of a filter for States and Cities so that there is no ambiguity in search criterian.
